Tom has been deta@@ ined by the police .
your name is fa@@ mili@@ ar to me .
it is compu@@ ted at 10@@ ,000 yen .
today I have a lot of things to do .
I studied for a year in Boston .
it doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
he doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears !
should I open the windows ?
during my last spring vacation I took a job in a restaurant to help pay the costs of my trip abroad .
and , they &apos;ve already tor@@ n up the garden .
they make toys at this factory .
she almost got away with it .
I already told you .
the lady wearing sunglasses seemed very strange .
where &apos;s the beach ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the b@@ ass guitar .
she sp@@ read honey thi@@ ckly on her to@@ ast .
do you spend more time with your friends or with your family ?
no one who is a decent human being could possibly support this project .
first of all , power off your c@@ ell@@ ph@@ ones and rema@@ in silent .
he decided that if God didn &apos;t exist then everything was per@@ mitted .
get rid of her .
swimming regularly is good for your health .
the woman sleep@@ s in the bedroom .
open the door !
does Tom have a hunting license ?
where was Tom working then ?
he is no longer a boy .
that &apos;s quite meaningless .
Tom isn &apos;t a very nice guy .
you are not at all what I expected .
that wasn &apos;t such a bad idea .
will you be doing that again ?
Tom seems unsure .
too good to be true .
I remember both of you .
he gave up going abroad to study because of his father &apos;s sudden death .
he sh@@ ined his shoes .
how much is the mon@@ thly rate ?
we took advantage of the fine weather to play tennis .
we could sure do with some rain .
aren &apos;t you going to sing ?
then you just have to fill out this card .
Tom told me what happened .
there was not a c@@ loud in the sky .
I can &apos;t raise our child by myself .
they &apos;re not afraid of hard work .
this time , you &apos;ve crossed the line !
you should try to make the most of your opportun@@ i@@ ties .
did anyone see you come in ?
Tom can no longer live here .
Tom died of li@@ ver cancer .
it appears to me you &apos;re mista@@ ken .
are you a tre@@ k@@ kie ?
the pro@@ je@@ ctor doesn &apos;t work .
I ju@@ dged you too quickly .
the Russi@@ ans are on our side .
dry wood bur@@ ns well .
Tom was offered a leading r@@ ole in a hor@@ ror movie .
there &apos;s no one by that name here .
Mary kept checking her watch .
you must start soon .
it &apos;s snowing there .
in contra@@ st to yesterday , it isn &apos;t hot at all today .
it happened so fast .
I need to speak with you right away .
I held my breath and waited .
I don &apos;t have time for nonsense .
what &apos;s your favorite thing to do in your free time ?
what time does the store open ?
I know that it is high@@ ly unlikely that we &apos;ll see any whales today .
this is a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are .
today pi@@ lot fa@@ ti@@ gue seems more likely .
the best way to catch a train on time is to make sure to miss the one that pre@@ ce@@ des it .
there &apos;s no need to be afraid .
the storm let up .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
the person who wants nothing , hopes for nothing , and f@@ ears nothing can never be an artist .
he has red hair and fre@@ ck@@ les .
you &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t believe his good fortun@@ e .
Tom found Mary &apos;s diary .
we had breakfast .
Tom is a fast eater .
Tom is good , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve no proof to the contr@@ ary .
the wicked wi@@ tch p@@ ushed her into the deep water .
Tom slept in his office .
Tom was going to lie , but he ended up sp@@ illing the be@@ ans .
stay close .
it &apos;s like bed@@ la@@ m in here .
she has water@@ ed the plants .
Tom fa@@ ked his death .
open the door !
see you next week !
it is car@@ eless of you to say such things .
I &apos;ll put some salt on the meat .
Mary told John the secret .
he says we should go that way .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was thirsty .
there were some students in the classroom .
I &apos;d like to help you .
tell him where he should go .
you should never ask a woman how old she is .
no one expected her to win .
the squirrel is the guardian spir@@ it of our tri@@ be .
the Pan@@ theon is now a church .
I apologize for what &apos;s happened here .

let &apos;s check the map .
can you put up with the noise ?
he has a Picasso .
we &apos;ll go by bus unless El@@ ena wants to take a taxi .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t walk any longer .
it &apos;s well worth it .
he d@@ ried his sweaty fore@@ head .
Tom slept on the couch .
you &apos;d better not go there again .
I &apos;m watching .
Tom has a daughter named Mary .
I would give it to them .
have you ever been stuck in an elevator ?
don &apos;t forget to change the cat li@@ tter .
I think that &apos;s a lot of ho@@ g@@ wash .
Tom is a car me@@ chan@@ ic .
Tom is good at chess , too .
I already said no .
it wasn &apos;t worth as much as they were char@@ ging for it .
didn &apos;t you miss anything ?
she really got on my ner@@ ves .
we ate a ha@@ sty m@@ ea@@ l and left immediately .
did Pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i intelligence really know nothing about the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist &apos;s wh@@ ere@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts ?
he slammed his door shut .
are you saying this doesn &apos;t matter ?
let me put this differ@@ ently .
we celebra@@ ted our tenth wedding anni@@ vers@@ ary yesterday .
who wants to kill you ?
just between us , he &apos;s not a deep thin@@ ker .
the fact cannot be den@@ i@@ ed .
put your toys away .
a lot of bic@@ y@@ cles are il@@ le@@ g@@ ally parked in front of the station .
Tom is sha@@ ving .
her youngest child is five years old .
how could you do that ?
she has a magne@@ tic person@@ ality .
Tom seems in@@ sin@@ c@@ ere .
it &apos;s as if Tom and Mary were made for each other .
they don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
I feel like a drink .
I can no longer stand this noise .
I &apos;m holding in my hands a book by Sus@@ ann@@ a Ta@@ mar@@ o .
if I were you , I would wait and see .
she &apos;s nuts .
in Den@@ mark , there aren &apos;t any yellow post@@ bo@@ xes .
Tom wants to say hello .
we &apos;re not desperate yet .
have you got 5@@ ,000 yen you could lend me ?
what are you going to do to me ?
should I close the door ?
Unfortunately , I never got the chance to meet her .
we fight all the time .
he &apos;s smart .
don &apos;t tell Tom anything .
the answer miss@@ es the point .
he offered to help me .
if you would like to have fur@@ ther information , please conta@@ ct me .
watch us .
if I had known it , I would have told it to you .
a ca@@ b is waiting .
you will not speak to me like that .
Tom was sitting in the dark , smoking a cigarette .
he doesn &apos;t show any sign of life .
could you give us a minute ?
rock , paper , sc@@ is@@ sors .
do you have a website ?
can we at least think about it for a minute ?
I think you &apos;re the most beautiful girl I &apos;ve ever seen .
even though the train was late , we made it in time .
he knows how to fly a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
you re@@ mind me of my son .
I read this book when I was in college .
Tom loved bananas .
a pencil is sticking out of your pocket .
if only I were such a beautiful and talented person .
I think it must &apos;ve been Tom who sent Mary that note .
the heat was unbe@@ ar@@ able .
I have to get up quite early tomorrow .
it was in@@ e@@ vit@@ able .
I ask about apples , and you answer me about p@@ ears .
newsp@@ apers lay s@@ ca@@ ttered all over the floor .
at that time , white bread and meat were considered a lu@@ x@@ ury .
the family loves to watch murder myster@@ ies together .
we were crazy about each other .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .

this statue belongs to us .
please do not think of a pink elephant right now .
please don &apos;t make me help Tom .

&apos;@@ Po@@ or boy ! &apos; said the old poet again , taking him by the hand , and leading him into his room . &apos; come to me , and we &apos;ll soon make thee warm again , and I will give thee some wine , and some roa@@ sted apples for thy supper , my pretty child ! &apos;
he can &apos;t be under thirty .
I don &apos;t want that one .
do you drink wine ?
do Tom and Mary have learning di@@ sa@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ?
she might not know that we are here .
she has a bottle of milk every morning .
I don &apos;t need that kind of stress in my life .
she must be mad at me .

does anybody else know about this ?
Tom asked Mary for John &apos;s telephone number .
you can be such a dra@@ ma que@@ en , Tom .

there are sentences whose translation into certain languages is sen@@ sel@@ ess and , th@@ ere@@ fore , should be avoided .
she confessed her love to him .
I &apos;m so tired !

it is very rude of you to expect me to eat food that I do not want to .
I bought a new handbag .
she re@@ sen@@ ted being called a co@@ ward .
but he is still alive ?
this telephone is out of order .
no doubt he will pass the examination .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
I &apos;m not sure Tom is willing to help us .
it &apos;s na@@ i@@ ve of you to believe that .
she rejected him .
I usually get up at 7 : 00 .
show me the photos , please .

she isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom speaks excellent Russian , but his German is ab@@ y@@ s@@ mal .
&quot; why is your room pink , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
he is not really a friend , just an acqua@@ in@@ tance .
do you anno@@ y your brothers ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I saw a man knocked down by a car .
there &apos;s not enough coffee .

I don &apos;t expect anything from Tom .
I &apos;ll introdu@@ ce you my brother .

the decision is ours to make .
he had breakfast all alone .
you &apos;re unbelie@@ v@@ able .
take your time . it &apos;s a mar@@ athon , not a sp@@ r@@ int .
I can neither con@@ firm nor den@@ y this .
it &apos;s a mira@@ cle that he wasn &apos;t killed in the accident .
you can still change your mind .
Tom thinks Mary isn &apos;t here .
you should tell your mother as soon as possible .
the streets are alive with shopp@@ ers .
Tom is going to do that again .
it &apos;s not like it used to be .

I saw the house .
all work has been carried out by exper@@ ts .

whenever I see him he reminds me of my late grandfather .
what if she doesn &apos;t like me ?
I &apos;m sel@@ fish .
could you do that ?
may I interrupt you ?
could you put these in a box ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
my parents p@@ ushed me to quit the baseball club .
I hate driving .
did you enjoy the salad ?
if that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
I have no desire to do that .
he climbed the stairs .
Tom hand@@ ed Mary the letter op@@ ener .

I cannot tell you how disgu@@ sted I felt with myself when I reali@@ zed what I was doing .
Tom is upstairs pa@@ cking .
Tom &apos;s conscious .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
it is not what you read but how you read it that counts .
it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen you smile .
after it ra@@ ins and the ground is da@@ mp , it &apos;s eas@@ ier to pu@@ ll wee@@ ds .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
is his father alive ?
he received quite a few letters this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what happened that night .

I didn &apos;t know the truth until yesterday .
Produ@@ c@@ tivity is the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e &apos;s most important char@@ ac@@ teri@@ stic .

Jane kept silent for a long time .
that &apos;s a photo of my sister .
I broke a swe@@ at running on the trea@@ d@@ mi@@ ll .

now would be a good time .
Tom already did that .
she learned English with great ea@@ ger@@ ness .
we must pun@@ ish him sever@@ ely .
I &apos;ll call the police .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
the joke loses everything when the jo@@ ker laugh@@ s himself .
Tom came to help .
I haven &apos;t read the report .
will the police come ?
my brother sen@@ ds you his warm regar@@ ds .
who should I vote for ?
didn &apos;t I tell you to close the door ?

I challenge you to a fight .
who is your favorite composer ?

there was no ir@@ ri@@ tation on his part .
the accused thief is on trial now .
China is a major econom@@ ic power , with one of the fa@@ stest growing econom@@ ies in the world .

I decided to tell him that I love her .
I have to know why .
Tom became angry .
did you recognize your old class@@ mate ?
I &apos;m of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher .
I like to play the piano .
this is quite difficult for Tom .
they aren &apos;t related .
what was done to you doesn &apos;t excuse what you did .
the children are already tired .

Tom and Mary told John that they were happy .
I should &apos;ve known Tom would be here , too .

prices are going up .
in my opinion , stress @-@ free learning is the most effe@@ ctive .

call me when you get there .
I know him quite well .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
you should wear a coat .
we &apos;re like a big family here .
as a result of always being hungry and fa@@ tigu@@ ed , that dog finally died .

I might be your only friend .

we are looking for a house with a garage .
the weak are food for the strong .
she lives next door to us .
Tom said he had to go somewhere .

what a shot !
it was not you who ate the cake I made , it was your sister .

you can wait here .
Tom is the same age as Mary .
it won &apos;t just happen over@@ night .

what have I missed ?
straight away , Mary put the wa@@ ff@@ le ir@@ on she had won to use .
could you take me to this seat ?
I can &apos;t let you go in there alone .
write Tom .
Tom may be old , but he &apos;s in good shape .
you can close your eyes to re@@ ality but not to memories .

Tom never wears red .
they are inse@@ par@@ able .
he bought an English book at a bookstore .
Tom is often late for school .

I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sports car .
this is my room . you can &apos;t just bar@@ ge in like that !
I prefer a cotton bl@@ ouse .
Tom has been doing a pretty good job of el@@ u@@ ding the police , but eventually he &apos;ll get caught .
I paid c@@ as@@ h for the car .

the fact is appar@@ ent to everybody .
men are so useless .
it needs exer@@ ci@@ se .

this clock is mine .
we are the country of c@@ low@@ ns ?
you aren &apos;t allowed to do that .
the statesman is wor@@ thy of respect .
Tom was desperate to escape .
this book is written in a rather simple English and is thus suitable for beg@@ inn@@ ers .
give me that camera .
I cannot thank him enough .
Tom answered my question .
Tom is just sitting on the porch , doing nothing .
do you take work home with you ?

what a great idea !
Tom &apos;s new camera can take ima@@ ges with much higher pi@@ x@@ el counts than his old one could .
I &apos;ll ask you these questions .
he took to A@@ ki@@ ko from the moment he met her .
we don &apos;t have that information .
Tom and I &apos;ll be in the lob@@ by waiting for you .
my je@@ ans shr@@ ank in the wash .
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
he asked her some questions .
I &apos;d like to volunteer my ser@@ vices .

do you think you &apos;re o@@ be@@ se ?
Con@@ gress passed the bill .
we &apos;re going to name him Tom .
they say he &apos;s the best tennis player .
how can I tell it just to Tom without telling everybody else ?
have you already made friends with her ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
answer me !
everyone in the car said they wanted to get out and stre@@ tch their legs .
I want to be an astronaut .
a rat ran across the road .
how is this even possible ?
I cannot do the work on my own .
sometimes I wish I had a twin brother . that &apos;d be fun .
such a tri@@ vi@@ al thing is out of the question .
I sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours .
Mary immediately recogni@@ zed his voice . it was Tom !
how many people are in this room ?
these ty@@ pes of books have almost no valu@@ e .
there &apos;s still a lot to do .

I &apos;m not very optimi@@ stic .

o that I had so much power !
you ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
kiss Tom for me .
I want to know why you lied to me .
I &apos;m not really very thirsty .
I can only tell you what I know .
I &apos;m good at tennis .

how clever !
try it once again .

I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .

do you know what they want ?
Tom suffered from a heart attack and almost died waiting for the ambulance .
I like to watch TV .
I can &apos;t spend the rest of my life living with Tom .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
it &apos;ll rain soon .
come home .
where does Tom have to do that ?
I &apos;m still un@@ decided .
I bought two cotton shi@@ rts .
don &apos;t hang up , but hold on please .
she is singing the latest popular songs .
in gener@@ al , men are taller than women .
how long have you two been enga@@ ged ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to lose some weight .
a decision will be even more difficult the longer you dela@@ y it .
I think Tom is smarter than Mary .
I always conf@@ use which side is port and which star@@ board .
this bookstore stopped selling JUMP .
I &apos;m afraid not .
whatever she told you , it &apos;s not true .
Tom has finished un@@ pa@@ cking his suitcase .

he made up his mind to write in his diary every day .
she began to cry .
however cold it may be , he still jo@@ gs 20 kilomet@@ ers every day .

I wish I could help you .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was dep@@ end@@ able .
I had a headache .
he is a good boy , and he is very strong .
Tom speaks excellent French , but his English isn &apos;t very good .
I was wounded by her comments .

he was at home .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn to help wash the dishes .
I can beat Tom .
only a third of the students came to class today .
suddenly , something unexpected happened .
and then everyone started laughing .
do you believe in ange@@ ls ?
I can do it without you .
you are hearing things .
Tom saw a girl sitting all alone , so he went over to talk to her .
I asked Tom if he was nervous .
when do you want to meet Tom ?
I barely had time to finish this report before the meeting .
I went to Nagas@@ aki .
Tom &apos;s had a lot of girl@@ friends .
Tom never complains .
please leave me alone . I am busy .
I could spend hours in here .
our cat &apos;s f@@ ur has lost its lu@@ ster .
Tom has been in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated since 2013 .
you &apos;re absolutely right !
this story does not make sense !
my feet are killing me .
do you have a map of Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
I thought you might be curious .
that evening I left my tip under a coffee cup , which I left upside down on the table .
I &apos;d rather die than do what you &apos;re asking me to do .
this is the tri@@ cky part .
I don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck about what you think .
some boys came into the classroom .
a dog is a loyal animal .
Mary is mad at me because she thinks I stole her boyfriend .
I left the window open .
so far as I can remember , there is not one word in the G@@ osp@@ els in pra@@ ise of intelligence .
be con@@ tent with your lot ; one cannot be first in everything .
which is cheaper , the bus or the street car ?
been there , done that .
when was the last time you slept in this room ?
the quarrel had un@@ fortun@@ ate con@@ sequ@@ ences .
what will I forget to write ?
did you already do your homework ?
Tom seems to be de@@ pressed .
above all , fa@@ me means dying at the right time .
my mother sp@@ ends a lot of money on clothes .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bus@@ h .
then , the train scre@@ e@@ ched to a halt .
it &apos;s a phone call from a Mr Brown .
who wrote these letters ?
I study French , too .
it &apos;s open .
the person on the left ru@@ ins the bal@@ ance of the picture .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
I wish you weren &apos;t always so busy .
Tom looked very young .
he is Ra@@ mu@@ du .
the rain hasn &apos;t stopped yet , has it ?
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
it was a new experience for her .
where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s hope .
Tom died three days after he arrived in Boston .
don &apos;t you have to go to school today ?
did you clean your room ?
what scared you ?
how does she do this ?
is that your sister ?
Tom has some advice for us .
E@@ st@@ on@@ ia has its own na@@ tion@@ al an@@ them .
he dec@@ ei@@ ves others with his appear@@ ance .
I can &apos;t help but feel par@@ tly responsible .
I don &apos;t feel good about it .
now it &apos;s your turn .
I believe in the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
Tom is in police cu@@ sto@@ dy now .
I would like to have a look at your colle@@ ction of sta@@ mp@@ s .
none of us saw Tom and Mary do that .
were you able to make it to the station on time to catch the first train this morning ?
she &apos;s honest enough , but can you really trust her ?
he drank the whisky as if it were water .
Tom ra@@ ised his glass and said , &quot; T@@ o the happy couple ! &quot;
how come you &apos;re so crazy ?
thanks , M@@ om .
Americans under the age of eighteen aren &apos;t allowed to vote in pre@@ siden@@ tial elec@@ tions .
we were able to catch the last train .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a man .
why don &apos;t you answer your dad ?
does it often snow in the winter here ?
I &apos;m sorry . I forgot .
is the patient prepared for surgery ?
he attemp@@ ted to climb the fence to no ava@@ il .
the truth knocked the breath out of him .
his car was seriously da@@ ma@@ ged .
Tom said Mary is ready .
why didn &apos;t you try the dress on before you bought it ?
anybody is better than nobody .
OK , I &apos;ll order it .
I don &apos;t care for sports .
the boy who writes best w@@ ins the pri@@ ze .
he has cor@@ por@@ al &apos;s stri@@ pes .
a man who lacks resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness is useless .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to change Mary &apos;s mind .
the day is short and there &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom got here on time .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of movie .
where do I get off ?
Gorill@@ as cannot use their lips and ton@@ gu@@ es to speak , but they can communi@@ ca@@ te with people in other ways .
do you think French is difficult ?
how dare you talk about Tom like that !
Unfortunately , an er@@ ror has occurred .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was hungry .
have you kissed her yet ?
Tom ba@@ cked out at the last moment .
I am laughing at Tom .
I have hun@@ dre@@ ds of such exam@@ ples in my computer .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
please move the chair . it &apos;s in the way .
Mary first came to Boston when she was three years old .
don &apos;t scre@@ w with me !
is your car new ?
get out of the kitchen .
our policy is to satis@@ fy our custom@@ ers .
will you pass me the salt , please ?
you don &apos;t have to talk to me if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
Tom and Mary told John that they were ready to leave .
I can not understand the psych@@ ology of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents .
all grown @-@ ups were once children .
do you think Tom saw it ?
Tom can swim no more than a stone can .
I &apos;m fin@@ ishing my homework .
you should school yourself to be patient .
the store was rela@@ tively empty .
why should I pay ?
how can someone who knows the language so well have such a thick accent ?
kno@@ wing a topic is one thing , but teaching it is a whole no@@ ther story .
he gets mad very easily .
the only time he fee@@ ds the dog is when his wife is away on a trip .
I &apos;m impressed with how much you &apos;ve improved .
I don &apos;t get the con@@ ne@@ ction .
it &apos;s time to get up .
he was way behind on his rent . as a result , he was evi@@ cted from his apartment .
I like cookies .
please give me back my pen .
the voice re@@ min@@ ded me of my mother .
after your death you will be what you were before your bir@@ th .
there was a s@@ mu@@ dge of li@@ p@@ stick on his cheek , and his tie was lo@@ ose .
Tom is the person who hit Mary .
Tom was kind of surprised when Mary said that she &apos;d do that .
whose house is across from yours ?
water is as precious as air .
no one was watching us .
U@@ kra@@ ini@@ an girls are the most beautiful girls in the world .
I went to a nu@@ de beach in France .
Tom was th@@ ou@@ ght@@ less , wasn &apos;t he ?
we &apos;d better stop .
let &apos;s go to the beach .
let us brie@@ fly re@@ call an important result from group theory .
Roman Em@@ peror Cali@@ gu@@ la had a horse called In@@ c@@ it@@ a@@ tus which means fast .
the King and Que@@ en were over@@ jo@@ yed when they saw their children , and they all lived happ@@ ily together in the beautiful palace .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was suspicious .
there &apos;s an apple in this boy &apos;s pocket .
Tom might be Canadian .
it &apos;s a pity that I don &apos;t understand French better .
let &apos;s see .
my mother sent me a birthday present .
Mr. Ka@@ to teach@@ es us English .
I wanted to help you .
Tom is hiding in his room again .
Tom , however , was already in love with a girl called Mary .
Tom closed the door quiet@@ ly .
Tom took off his head@@ ph@@ ones .
she gave me her phone number .
the cat chased the m@@ ouse , but couldn &apos;t catch it .
she just wanted to get rid of me .
when are you going to give me my book back ?
shut up . if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll be thrown out .
my pencil is red .
please think it over and let me know your decision .
who is supposed to do this job ?
he satisfied his thir@@ st with a large glass of beer .
&quot; have you got yourself a ticket yet ? &quot; - &quot; N@@ o , have you ? &quot;
would Tom really buy that for you ?
the tip of the knife is sharp .
it happened that the day was my birthday .
I &apos;ve missed Tom .
we were studying all afternoon .
she fol@@ ded it in paper .
was it good ?
Tom drinks .
