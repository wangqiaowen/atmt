Tom doesn &apos;t kno@@ w how to play the b@@ ass guitar .

the woman sleep@@ s in the bedroom .
open th@@ e door !
does T@@ om have a hunting license ?
where was Tom working then ?

that &apos;@@ s quite meaningless .
Tom isn &apos;t a very nice guy .

it is dangerous to drive so fast .
T@@ om plans to go to Boston next week .
breakfast is ready .
what area of China do you like the best ?
Tom and Mary told John they hadn &apos;t seen Alice in ye@@ ars .

she &apos;s too old for me .
I want to say I &apos;m sorry .
Tom seems to be unwilling to correct his mistakes .
the col@@ our@@ s of her dress and shoes go well together .
he got related with her through marriage .
sh@@ ar@@ p &apos;s the w@@ or@@ d !
Tom called Mary up from the airport .
she isn &apos;t as young as she looks .
it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s so hea@@ v@@ y that I can &apos;t li@@ f@@ t it .
Mary said she &apos;s been asked not do that again .
we have a farm .
do you know how I can get there ?
sometimes it is import@@ ant to take a decision quickly .
I like her . she &apos;s so beautiful !
the meeting ended earlier than us@@ u@@ al .

have you ever been in Boston before ?
he had a traffic accident on his way to school .
I don &apos;t k@@ n@@ ow what has happened to him .

due to incre@@ asing anxi@@ ety , Tom drank coffee in the mid@@ dle o@@ f the night which did not h@@ el@@ p .
his name was Tom .
I understand that .

we think that &apos;s a good thing .
how did you know Tom would be there ?
he &apos;ll win for sure .
I don &apos;t want you to ha@@ ve anything to do with Tom .
Tom has no desire to go to the movies .
I met somebody online .
it is said that there will be an elec@@ tion soon .
I bought her a new car .
tell Tom th@@ a@@ t I &apos;m doing my ho@@ me@@ work .
open the cur@@ tains and let the sunshine in .
you should apologize to Tom for being late .
Tom has t@@ ol@@ d me a lot about you .
do you know us ?

I go on foot .

have you done this kind of thing before ?
this room is not suitable fo@@ r sleeping .
I &apos;ll call my husband .
you didn &apos;t need t@@ o take a taxi .
my time has not yet come .
I just bought another sweater . now I have 2@@ 1 !
how is it made ?
Mary is traveling by herself .
his a@@ shes are buried here .
I love my daughter .

her wo@@ r@@ k is also valuable .
they had the work finished .
we n@@ e@@ e@@ d to talk .
do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
you could never do that .
you &apos;re t@@ emp@@ ting fate .
there wasn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t anything I could do to help To@@ m .
she has s@@ m@@ all br@@ ea@@ st@@ s , but I don &apos;t mind .
neither Tom nor Mary has been helping us with that .
you shouldn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t do his work .
did you get wet ?
I had nothing better to do .
we &apos;re all here except fo@@ r him .
I wa@@ s the one who t@@ au@@ ght Tom to read .

Mary is much fa@@ tter than she used to be .

Tom d@@ yed his hair bro@@ wn .
suddenly he saw m@@ e .
my time is expensive because time is t@@ he most precious thing w@@ e have . but for learning lan@@ gu@@ a@@ ges , I always have the ti@@ m@@ e . because with each new word we learn , our world be@@ comes a ta@@ d more interesting .
the atmosphere prote@@ cts us from mete@@ ors .

the pro@@ di@@ gal son returned home .
&quot; have you ever thought of killing yo@@ ur@@ self ? &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m not a p@@ er@@ s@@ o@@ n who would end their own life . &quot;
there are many beautiful par@@ ks in Boston .
you don &apos;t like me , d@@ o you ?
do you think an@@ yo@@ ne can see me ?

his object is to pass the test .
Col@@ umbus discovered America in 14@@ 92 .
Tom is clever and resour@@ ce@@ ful .

do you think that Tom was the one who did that ?
s@@ he is afraid of cats .
Tom and Mary don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t even know each other .
Tom is violent and dangerous .
China is perhaps the only co@@ un@@ try in th@@ e world where the temperature is contr@@ olled by the government .

I wonder ho@@ w Tom will g@@ et out of th@@ a@@ t m@@ ess .
this is a joke , right ?
Tom never ch@@ anges .
he a@@ ck@@ no@@ wle@@ dged it to be true .
she died a happy woman .
I don &apos;t want to regre@@ t later in life having mi@@ ss@@ ed out on s@@ om@@ e@@ thing in my youth .

as f@@ a@@ r hou@@ sing goes , it is very poor in Japan .
I &apos;m in trouble because of you .

Tom r@@ ushed off .
the radio is too l@@ ou@@ d . turn the v@@ ol@@ u@@ me down .
th@@ e door may be lo@@ ck@@ ed .

why do humans fear mon@@ sters ? they are the worst mon@@ sters in the w@@ or@@ ld !
Mary was born blind .
Tom asked Mary to clean his office .
it was hard to believe .

Bob helped me .
Tom and Mary told John that they were bored .
Tom and Mary both prefer watching com@@ e@@ dies .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
I don &apos;t k@@ n@@ ow why you listen to her .
Tom laid do@@ wn the gun .
she recently came out as a les@@ bi@@ an .
do you want to go s@@ om@@ e@@ wh@@ ere ? Tom &apos;s coming , t@@ o@@ o .
it &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .
I haven &apos;t apologized to Tom yet .
do you think that those super@@ her@@ oes are en@@ do@@ wed with tal@@ ents we don &apos;t pos@@ s@@ ess ?
he has a ni@@ ce income .
Tom is allergic to da@@ ir@@ y produ@@ cts .
we know what you &apos;re l@@ oo@@ king for .
Tom will be angry .
this doesn &apos;t mean a thing to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a consci@@ ence .
is there a bro@@ o@@ k anywhere near Gre@@ en G@@ ab@@ l@@ es ?
I can &apos;t write in A@@ ra@@ bic . I don &apos;@@ t have an Ar@@ ab@@ ic ke@@ y@@ board .

I want it to be a surprise .
he com@@ mitted suicide by hanging hi@@ m@@ self .

I &apos;ve been wa@@ i@@ ti@@ n@@ g her@@ e for him since this morning .
the plants are thirsty for water .
Tom and his fri@@ en@@ ds play po@@ ker almost every Friday night .
some teachers peel potatoes while teaching .
the child cried for help .
I washed myself and felt much better .
my parents expect me to enter the university .
he is by far the best stu@@ dent .
Mary did it in her own way .
Tom do@@ zed off .
Tom has so many fr@@ i@@ ends th@@ at h@@ e can &apos;t remember all their names .
I will send you a tape of my vo@@ ice .
some@@ ti@@ m@@ es I don &apos;t get you .
have you ever been mu@@ gged ?
when I heard the news , I wanted to cry .
Tom and Mary told John that they th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t Alice w@@ ou@@ ld b@@ e la@@ te .

these are ge@@ t@@ ting hard to find .
how disgu@@ sting !
I think that &apos;s an interesting profes@@ sion .
I wa@@ nt freedom .
I am ashamed of myself fo@@ r my poor English .
Tom didn &apos;t notice m@@ e .
all of t@@ he to@@ ys ar@@ e woo@@ de@@ n .
Mar@@ y is a fine @-@ looking woman .
why a@@ re you looking at me like that ?
he has no wife , no children and no fri@@ ends .
I &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ d rather walk than w@@ a@@ it for a bus .
you will have to ap@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ ze wh@@ en you see him .
it is quite natural for her to get angry .
T@@ om is a few inches sh@@ or@@ ter t@@ ha@@ n Mary .
he ran across the street , leaving her alone .
M@@ ary just got her hair done .
Vol@@ can@@ oes can be active , dor@@ m@@ ant , or ex@@ tin@@ ct .
Tom told me Mary wanted to se@@ e me .
the student coun@@ cil discussed pl@@ ans for the gra@@ du@@ a@@ tion .
I am as I am , b@@ ut I am not al@@ ways what I want to be .

th@@ e moment he saw me he ran a@@ way .
Tom talked with his friends yesterday .
Mary buried her fac@@ e in her hands and so@@ bbed un@@ contr@@ ol@@ la@@ bly .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem now .
Tom explained to Mary why it would be a go@@ od idea for her to do that .
I was lying .
I don &apos;t en@@ j@@ o@@ y soli@@ tude .
we want you to feel welcome .

I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
she bought chi@@ cken .
we slept in a very small ten@@ t .
I really wasn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t expe@@ cti@@ n@@ g that from you .
everything he says is correct .
he could not res@@ ist the temptation .
why didn &apos;t you come earlier ?
generally sp@@ ea@@ king , Japanese women are mo@@ dest .
you need to be pretty fit to run up six fli@@ ghts of stairs .

To@@ m is the youngest child in his family .

come home at si@@ x .
as soon as I can get a decent video camera , I &apos;ll start making vide@@ os to put online .
Mary doesn &apos;t like par@@ sle@@ y .
these facts admit of no contra@@ dic@@ tion .
you ca@@ n think of the re@@ st yourself .
first , le@@ t &apos;s talk about what Tom did .
why isn &apos;t To@@ m doing t@@ hat ?
a large crowd had ga@@ thered on the stre@@ et .
Mary could tell by the way Tom slammed the door that h@@ e wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom now wears a wig .
she sings in the cho@@ ir .
Som@@ eh@@ ow , Tom knew .

Tom ma@@ jo@@ red in chemi@@ stry .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
I &apos;@@ ll be home by midnight at the latest .
my cat weighs about ten pounds .
just wondering how you are d@@ o@@ ing .
in the old days , things were a lot simp@@ ler .
do you know h@@ o@@ w to use this machine ?
Tom sat qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly staring at the fire .
give me some@@ thing t@@ o write wi@@ t@@ h .
the com@@ mit@@ tee is made up o@@ f ten mem@@ bers .
the world began without man and it shall end without him .
I have made my decision .
good afternoon .
she met him f@@ or breakfast .
that would take too l@@ ong .
every@@ body was ga@@ thered in t@@ he living room .
what &apos;@@ re yo@@ u going to do about these cock@@ ro@@ aches ?
it &apos;s not complicated .

I don &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t wan@@ t To@@ m to hear ab@@ ou@@ t this .

I wish I &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ d had more time to pre@@ p@@ are .

Mary gave Tom all the money she had on her .
she li@@ v@@ es with he@@ r par@@ ent@@ s .
th@@ e chemi@@ cal symbol H ex@@ press@@ es h@@ y@@ dro@@ gen .
does this s@@ ent@@ ence make sense ?
boys have no respect for girls .
yo@@ ur plan seems excellent .
I suspe@@ ct that Tom doesn &apos;t do his homework by him@@ self .
what country are you from ?
we have to be careful who we show these plans to .
the people knew he did not like them .

I didn &apos;t compla@@ in about anything .
the hal@@ l@@ mark of a soci@@ op@@ a@@ th is a lack of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
thanks to you .
Tom suggested that we go swimming .
everyone has the right to t@@ ak@@ e part in the government of his country , direc@@ tly or thro@@ u@@ gh fre@@ ely chosen repre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tives .

the stre@@ ets are alive wi@@ t@@ h sho@@ pp@@ ers .
Tom is going to do that again .
it &apos;s not li@@ k@@ e it used to be .

c@@ ou@@ l@@ d you put these in a box ?

I cannot tell you ho@@ w disgu@@ sted I f@@ el@@ t with myself when I re@@ ali@@ zed what I was doing .
Tom is upstairs pa@@ cking .
Tom &apos;s conscious .
I can &apos;@@ t understand why he did that .

after it ra@@ ins and the grou@@ n@@ d is da@@ mp , it &apos;s eas@@ ier to pu@@ ll wee@@ ds .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
is his father alive ?
he received quite a few letters this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what happ@@ en@@ ed that night .
ask Mary if she has en@@ ou@@ gh money to buy what she needs .
I didn &apos;t know the truth un@@ ti@@ l yesterday .
Produ@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity is the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e &apos;s most important char@@ ac@@ teri@@ stic .

I don &apos;t parti@@ cul@@ arly want to do that .
you want to do that work .
