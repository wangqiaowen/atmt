I won &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t wait for you .
we had a very vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous de@@ ba@@ te .
I ca@@ m@@ e here to see if there was something I could d@@ o to help , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be anything for me to do .

Tom decided to serve Mary brea@@ k@@ fast in bed .
I called our L@@ on@@ don office . they said t@@ hat Tom left for B@@ ost@@ on yesterday .
I think we can do that .
Tom never as@@ k@@ ed questi@@ ons .
I can &apos;t wa@@ it for school to start .
I al@@ ways take a ba@@ th in the morning .
are you listening to him ?
he has no respect for anyone .
everybody was o@@ be@@ ying the s@@ pe@@ ed li@@ m@@ it , so I knew there was likely a s@@ pe@@ ed t@@ ra@@ p ahead .
an in@@ j@@ ury is much so@@ oner forgotten than a@@ n insult .
Tom and Mary told John that th@@ e@@ y were fru@@ stra@@ ted .
call Tom and tell him to come her@@ e .
he was fully clo@@ th@@ ed .
he &apos;s a weak @-@ willed man .
that man was a wre@@ tch .
I live in Ka@@ ko@@ ga@@ wa .

Tom di@@ d@@ n &apos;t sta@@ y in Australia .
I do@@ n &apos;t care for wine .
we didn &apos;t even get that far .
don &apos;t expect me to believe such a tall story .

Tom was dirty .
I am a successful failure .
the ha@@ ll al@@ lows children in only on that day .
I know . I was there .
I might not be able to help .
I can &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t see w@@ ell .
n@@ ow I understand even less than before .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to be aware that Mary needed to do that .
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the cou@@ n@@ ter .
I &apos;d like to see you if possible .
Som@@ eh@@ ow , he we@@ as@@ eled himself out of j@@ ury duty .
this isn &apos;t a ga@@ me .
that &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s what I thought you said .
I &apos;d rather not discuss i@@ t now .

Tom pro@@ posed to me .
I bet the teacher &apos;s going to get mad !
Tom told me he &apos;ll join us later .
Tom &apos;s eyesight isn &apos;t as good a@@ s it used to be .
young people like hi@@ s books .
I grew up in a small town .
do you re@@ al@@ ly think that could happen ?
Mr Wil@@ der gave me your e @-@ mail ad@@ dr@@ ess .
please c@@ ir@@ cle t@@ he right answer .
isn &apos;t that your dic@@ tion@@ ary ?
could you please put th@@ a@@ t somewhere else ?
they talked about love .
Tom died with a knife in his back .
she ought t@@ o have arrived by now .
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
before winter I &apos;ll have the windows painted , as the paint on them is slowly pe@@ el@@ ing off , espe@@ ci@@ ally outside .
the baby can stand but can &apos;t walk .
Tom told me that you like to eat sp@@ ic@@ y food .
Tom called to say that he &apos;d be late .
I thought it was a joke .
can any of us speak Spanish ?
do you have a menu in English ?
the en@@ gine is pur@@ ring .
what do you have i@@ n your bag ?
isn &apos;t it enough for you ?
she is always compla@@ ining of her husband &apos;s small sal@@ ary .
do you want to know his name ?
I en@@ vy him .
I also want to try .
To@@ m cla@@ ims he doesn &apos;t watch much TV , but he wat@@ ches more than three hours e@@ v@@ er@@ y day .
he talked to the chairman .
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone .
I &apos;m sure th@@ a@@ t Mary can take care of her@@ sel@@ f .
where does Tom li@@ ve ?
someone left you a message .
how many people ?
just a moment .
sh@@ e received the electricity bill today .
the ex@@ port business isn &apos;t doing we@@ ll .
shall we stop soon ?
I know Tom is old .
who hel@@ ps her ?
W@@ ra@@ p t@@ he d@@ ough in clear film and chi@@ ll for 15 to 30 mi@@ nu@@ tes .
you wo@@ n &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
a cat is l@@ ying on the sofa .
it made me a little sad .
Tom can &apos;t get along with Mary .
seriously , don &apos;t be a stranger .
Tom has been extremely coo@@ per@@ a@@ tive .
he has a spi@@ der fe@@ tish .
I suggest you sta@@ y out of my way .
my travel fe@@ es to J@@ ap@@ a@@ n are paid for by the university .
are you sure that you want to do this ?
Mary lost h@@ er favorite pe@@ n .
this steak is too t@@ ough .
Dr. H@@ ide@@ o N@@ o@@ gu@@ ch@@ i died in Africa i@@ n 19@@ 2@@ 8 .
I wi@@ ll raise my children so that they will be prote@@ cted from superstition .
e@@ ve@@ ry day I go to the ca@@ f@@ é and have coffee .
I invited him over to my place .
bug of@@ f !
she looked at me like I was crazy .
you are the last person wh@@ om I expected to meet h@@ ere .
I have a message for Tom .
I str@@ olled al@@ on@@ g the streets to kill time .
is it true that you argu@@ ed with Tan@@ inn@@ a ?
Bel@@ ie@@ f is the death of intelligence .
life is for living .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s father .
even the most beautiful rose will s@@ om@@ e@@ day wi@@ lt .
h@@ e is not coming , either .
Tom finally got hi@@ s wish .
are you coming to the store with me ?
I am coun@@ ting in German .
you &apos;ve got your whole li@@ f@@ e ahead of y@@ o@@ u .
Tom asked me who was responsible for the accident .
I interpre@@ ted what he said in French into Japanese .
Tom is fairly preten@@ ti@@ ous .
he comes to see me nearly every day .
To@@ m is full of life .
do you have a vi@@ ol@@ in ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
it ra@@ ises a red flag for bus@@ in@@ ess@@ men .
six times th@@ re@@ e equ@@ als ei@@ gh@@ teen .
N@@ et @-@ pro@@ fit comes to 10 million dollars ever@@ y year .
the light is off .
I didn &apos;t expect thanks anyway .
she mi@@ st@@ ook me for my brother .
Japan im@@ por@@ ts various ra@@ w ma@@ teri@@ als from abroad .
I don &apos;t know either twin .
you won &apos;@@ t have that problem .
they &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ re self @-@ sufficient .
my girlfriend still do@@ es@@ n &apos;t know my parents .
his knowledge of ge@@ o@@ gr@@ ap@@ h@@ y is in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent .
that has nothing to do with you .
I wan@@ t@@ ed to talk to you about what happened .
To@@ m po@@ ked the fire with a stick .
there was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters .
she s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed her pride .
you have made him what he is .
this is a story w@@ ri@@ t@@ ten in easy English .
you ought to find nice shoes here .
it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s not th@@ a@@ t bad .
it &apos;s clear@@ ing up .
do both Tom and Ma@@ ry snor@@ e ?
quality , not quantity .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to ask .
Mary told Tom th@@ at she thought John was impolite .
Tom laughed at the misunder@@ standing .
Tom spent three y@@ ears in Australia .
I can &apos;t give you these .
we were all tired .
it looks like Tom only wears expensive clothes .
that &apos;s probably th@@ e best idea to begin with .
nobody answered my questi@@ on .
how many pan@@ das are there in thi@@ s zoo ?
were you in America l@@ as@@ t month ?
I used to be a drug addi@@ ct .
i@@ f you don &apos;t want to do i@@ t , you don &apos;t have to .
do you ha@@ ve any ice ton@@ gs ?
Tom sent Mary a picture of his ne@@ w kit@@ ten .
what &apos;ll Tom win ?
Tom lacks imagin@@ ation .
I &apos;m only here by mistake .
I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
your offer is a li@@ f@@ e @-@ sa@@ ver .
Tom lo@@ o@@ ks a little annoyed .
is that do@@ g m@@ ale or f@@ em@@ ale ?
Mary &apos;s not pretty , but she isn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t u@@ gly , either .
why is everything so complicated ?
my father is always bu@@ sy .
S@@ am , d@@ on &apos;t !
&quot; Tom knows . &quot; &quot; he does ? did you tell him ? &quot;
I &apos;ll dea@@ l with this pro@@ blem as so@@ on as I can .
why do@@ es@@ n &apos;t Tom ha@@ v@@ e to pay anything ?
I &apos;ve read that book .
she post@@ pon@@ ed her trip to M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
this book belongs to Pa@@ ol@@ o .
she has l@@ ong hair .
you should eat vegetables .
she worked from morning till night .
my uncle , who lives in Paris , came to see us .
do you read something besi@@ des the Bible ?
you &apos;re not pl@@ ann@@ ing to stay up all night , are you ?
you are such a crazy driver ; you drive me crazy .
the Japanese like t@@ o travel in groups .
I despi@@ se my parents .
the pri@@ n@@ ce says that the world wi@@ ll be saved by beauty ! and I main@@ tain that the reason he has such pla@@ yful ideas is that he is in love .
I don &apos;t understand how the h@@ u@@ man brain works .
Tom made Mary very happy .
let &apos;s go home , Tom .
how can I become a trusted user ?
the st@@ ea@@ k is well d@@ one .
many commen@@ ta@@ tors regar@@ d O@@ ba@@ ma as a cen@@ tr@@ ist .
sh@@ e talked to the chair@@ person .
who built it ?
do you happen to know how to get down@@ town from here ?
Tom put everything back on the shelf .
don &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t you think I know my own wife ?
I knew he was waiting for Mary .
I am divorced .
I wish you &apos;d stop doing that .
don &apos;t try to frigh@@ ten me .
s@@ he &apos;s not a good c@@ ook .
if I had enough money , I could buy thi@@ s book .
Tom and M@@ ary went hunting for E@@ a@@ ster eggs .
I am happy to hear your voice .
the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se are generally considered to be very indu@@ stri@@ ous .
the mist pre@@ vented him from seeing very fa@@ r .
I &apos;@@ ve do@@ ne that a few times .
the l@@ ast time that I sm@@ elled some@@ thing similar to this tea was in the gi@@ ra@@ ffe house at the zoo .
I &apos;ve never been so ha@@ pp@@ y to see potatoes in my life .
is it true that you &apos;ve never played po@@ ker before ?
it &apos;@@ s hard to please him .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
a square h@@ as four an@@ gl@@ es .
I don &apos;t have ti@@ m@@ e to listen to your life st@@ ory .
she fell in love with her teacher .
his daughter is a nurse .
it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s very cold this winter .
why don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t you say an@@ y@@ th@@ ing ?
Tom left the room .
she killed time reading a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine wh@@ il@@ e she waited .
have you ever tra@@ v@@ elled by plane ?
Tom wondered what Mary was so upset about .
I didn &apos;t want to l@@ ook foolish .
To@@ m passed t@@ he butter to Mary .
Tom bought a rose and gave it to Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you the reason why I did that .
you &apos;re really gi@@ f@@ ted .
my mother &apos;s reli@@ gion helped her to com@@ e to terms with my father &apos;s death .
stop hi@@ t@@ ting Tom .
thank you , C@@ ap@@ tain Ob@@ vi@@ ous .
I used to keep a diary when I was at high school .
how man@@ y di@@ ff@@ er@@ ent pieces are ther@@ e in Japanese chess ?
I know that doesn &apos;t loo@@ k good .
should I go to the party ?
Tom brought his dog to school .
is there any problem with fee@@ ding my dog ice cream ?
a for@@ ei@@ g@@ n language can &apos;t be ma@@ stered in a year or so .
let me give this to you be@@ for@@ e I forget .
Tom c@@ a@@ me at an in@@ oppor@@ tune time .
T@@ om didn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t have a chance .
the statement sounds impro@@ b@@ able .
he lost the watch which he had bought the day be@@ for@@ e .
my legs are as heavy as lead .
To@@ m was screa@@ ming .
why would Tom lie about something like that ?
Tom and Mary told John they wanted Alice to teach them how to do that .
I &apos;m waiting for a respon@@ se .
I h@@ op@@ e I never me@@ et him again .
wh@@ at do I owe him ?
this program has an in@@ tuitive user inter@@ face .
it depends on the situation .
waiter , the check , please .
Tom and Mary t@@ old John that they thought Alice was awake .
w@@ here would you go if you could time travel ?
how long do you intend to spend at the library ?
Tom often goes there .
this can@@ di@@ date is signifi@@ can@@ tly better compared to his pre@@ dec@@ essor .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
the bird was looking fo@@ r wor@@ m@@ s .
she pretended to be a student .
my favourite colour is red .
money can &apos;t buy life .
you &apos;re just jealous .
Tom and Mary told J@@ oh@@ n th@@ at the@@ y di@@ d@@ n &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t think Alice was sleepy .
he has good reason to g@@ et ve@@ ry angry .
Tom will t@@ ry .
Tom and Mary were b@@ ot@@ h born in Boston .
sh@@ e acc@@ eded to our de@@ man@@ ds .
Mana@@ gement tried to ap@@ pe@@ ase lab@@ or by off@@ ering them a b@@ on@@ us .
I missed the poin@@ t of the joke .
Tom told me to be k@@ in@@ d to others .
by the way , how old are you ?
they walked along the street side by side .
what was I talking about , again ?
Tom is non@@ pl@@ ussed .
you may say th@@ a@@ t it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s sh@@ it .
everything appears to be go@@ ing well .
I &apos;m looking for someone who speaks German .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
I &apos;m not ashamed that I am poor .
Tom ha@@ s to take medicine every three hours .
a coo@@ kie is under the table .
why &apos;d you do that ?
Marie had a cat .
give Tom his keys .
the village was silent .
th@@ at &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s why I told you that you shouldn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t go alone .
I di@@ d@@ n &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t really like the ste@@ w that Tom made .
not so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , children , I &apos;m not so young an@@ y@@ mo@@ re !
he is not a politi@@ cian but a lawyer .
I &apos;ll help you as soon as I &apos;ve done that .
we look forward to yo@@ u@@ r ent@@ ries .
he &apos;s unconscious .
leave m@@ e alone .
I don &apos;t understand this word . could you par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase it ?
hi , Sus@@ an . how are you ?
let &apos;s start with you .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tom only sleep@@ s about fi@@ ve ho@@ ur@@ s a night .
a@@ re you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
road traffic inju@@ ries are a major public health problem and a leading cause of death .
I know you think this i@@ s a st@@ up@@ id thing to do , but I plan to do it anyway .
no pas@@ sen@@ ger@@ s we@@ re injured .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
sto@@ p car@@ ping !
the m@@ ere thought of a snake makes me shi@@ ver .
it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s as c@@ le@@ ar a@@ s c@@ r@@ y@@ sta@@ l .
Tom didn &apos;t even have the de@@ cen@@ cy to admit it was his fault .
have you meas@@ ured it ?
Tom is a big boy .
you &apos;re Russian ?
Tom a@@ n@@ d Mary were busy .
she called you .
w@@ ha@@ t else did you see ?
d@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t keep bad company .
ther@@ e &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s no rest for the wicked .
please don &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t touch the ice with bare hands .
you should t@@ ell him the truth .
we think that the nar@@ row road was responsible fo@@ r the ac@@ ci@@ den@@ t .
yo@@ u &apos;re going to have to pay in advance .
we need more talented people .
her parents are older th@@ a@@ n o@@ ur@@ s .
I &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ m worried for you .
Tom lives near us .
having b@@ e@@ en left alone , the baby star@@ te@@ d to cry .
Tom should be here af@@ ter lunch .
almost three thousand people died .
sorry , I didn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t mean to interrupt you .
the book is new .
Tom has really taught me many things .
To@@ m and Mary ar@@ e the only survi@@ vor@@ s .
this is how I did it .
th@@ e D@@ iet bro@@ ke up in con@@ fu@@ sion .
Tom w@@ ou@@ ld treat you with respect .
nobody can for@@ es@@ e@@ e what &apos;@@ l@@ l ha@@ p@@ pen .
Tom takes after his father .
I already spoke t@@ o Tom .
I can &apos;t see the road sig@@ ns in this fo@@ g .
Tom makes a lot more money than I do .
my opinion is a little different from yours .
Tom is interested in French liter@@ at@@ ure .
get ready for school .
To@@ m put his h@@ and@@ s on Ma@@ ry &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
all the passengers were killed in the crash .
what good are those ?
do yo@@ u prefer cute guys o@@ r guys who have class ?
I told William , but h@@ e didn &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe me .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t h@@ e ?
&quot; objection , your hon@@ or . &quot; &quot; O@@ ver@@ ru@@ led . &quot;
almost everyone I know can speak French .
can I see you in my office for a minute ?
you &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ r@@ e not Canadian .
they grew angry .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
the first item on Tom &apos;s list of things to take wi@@ t@@ h him on his trip is his mobile phone re@@ char@@ ger .
have you decided whether yo@@ u are go@@ in@@ g into town by b@@ i@@ ke or by bus ?
were both Tom a@@ n@@ d Mary bo@@ r@@ n in Australia ?
what col@@ or car did you buy ?
I think that you &apos;re wrong .
could you give us a min@@ u@@ te ?
Oh , my God !
he did everything for her .
please bring it back tomorrow .
that &apos;s his spe@@ ci@@ al@@ ty .
Tom ate alone .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to no@@ t ha@@ v@@ e enough to eat .
he didn &apos;t exactly cover himself in gl@@ ory .
Tom wandered off .
I &apos;ll prote@@ ct Tom .
this regu@@ lation will take effect next year .
we bar@@ red the door and locked it .
the little boy grew very fast .
I was bored .
Tom said h@@ e didn &apos;t know why Mary had t@@ o do that .
rich as he is , he is not happy .
sh@@ e &apos;@@ s such a s@@ weetheart .
your explanation is too ab@@ stra@@ ct for me .
Vir@@ tu@@ es a@@ n@@ d girls are mo@@ st beautiful before kno@@ wing that they are beautiful .
h@@ e slammed the door ri@@ gh@@ t in my face .
we will have a math qui@@ z tomorrow .
I have a bicycle .
I don &apos;t feel comfortable here .
Tom doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust the government .
this is what he said .
the reason I succeeded was because I wa@@ s lucky .
she has a ke@@ en business sense .
she is li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to him .
obviously I a@@ gr@@ e@@ e that you should advance in life through your own eff@@ or@@ ts .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
I have a message for you from her .
before going to Fran@@ ce , Mr. Su@@ zuki studied French .
after lunch today , our plan is to take a walk in the park .
take action .
Mike takes af@@ te@@ r his father in everything .
Tom and Mary wondered if John cou@@ ld be per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed teach their children French .
the ini@@ tial symp@@ t@@ oms of t@@ he di@@ se@@ ase are fever and sore throat .
a cold rain fell over the city .
w@@ h@@ en should I pick you up tom@@ orrow ?
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al@@ is@@ m never took r@@ oo@@ t in America be@@ c@@ au@@ se the poor see themselves not as an explo@@ ited pro@@ let@@ ari@@ at , but as tem@@ por@@ ari@@ ly embar@@ ras@@ sed million@@ air@@ es .
she wore her hair in pla@@ its .
my cousin is h@@ oo@@ ked on s@@ mack .
To@@ m lives in a row house .
there are a couple of par@@ ks not too far from my house .
what else i@@ s there to say ?
he probably won &apos;t come .
she &apos;s afraid of getting sick again .
education is the be@@ st anti@@ do@@ te against violence .
we have to avoid the nu@@ cl@@ ear war by all means .
Tom said something to Mary .
you had be@@ t@@ ter not stay up late .
you had plenty of time .
h@@ ow much do I owe you for the tick@@ et ?
cook for me .
do you li@@ ke them ?
please come visit us more often .
Tom and Mary asked me to help them do that .
Ma@@ ry hasn &apos;t painted her room yet .
the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is well worth a v@@ is@@ it .
why ex@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ ly would you wan@@ t to do that ?
you &apos;ll find the letter under these p@@ apers .
to@@ day is not so cold .
you should go in there .
men &apos;s natural ri@@ ghts are equal ; claim is met by claim , eff@@ ort by eff@@ ort , and force by force .
he &apos;ll free@@ ze to de@@ at@@ h out here .
the fire destroyed three houses .
I don &apos;t want to see her an@@ y@@ more .
I thin@@ k that Tom is still sleepy .
you &apos;ll have to discuss that with Tom .
the train is coming .
copy t@@ his , please .
I th@@ ought that working in a Japanese company would impro@@ ve my Japanese , but it has only served to sh@@ ow me how f@@ ar I still have to go .
no@@ bo@@ dy can do th@@ a@@ t better than Tom .
she wanted to get away from every@@ day life .
I never inten@@ ded to hurt you .
there &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
she had never seen New York before , so I offered to show her around .
she looked gla@@ mor@@ ous .
I sat down on the cou@@ ch next to Tom .
few students are interested in reading this no@@ ve@@ l .
